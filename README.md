## Mixovnik
A constant-power panning 16-channel mixer width two AUX sends and returns, external mix input, CV Vol (unipolar mode) and CV Pan (bipolar mode) inputs. Also with mute and solo buttons.

## Quantovnik
A pitch quantizer with note info and bipolar-unipolar converter. Also with octave and course shift.

## Beatovnik
Based on the external BPM clock, the module generates 2x and 4x multiply and 2x and 4x divide clock signals. In addition, you can set the pulse width (proportionally for all outputs). The last important thing - CV output compatible 100% with Fundamental Delay CV Time input. This is a CV to time conversion, of course based on BPM.


Enjoy!
